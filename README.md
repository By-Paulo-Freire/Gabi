### Incomplete code

The objective here is to create a virtual assistant with a face. Right now, I only have the face... 

I started the project with HTML and CSS, now I'm refactoring into REACT components. The idea is to work basic skills, like HTML, CSS, refactoring code and React, before getting into the heavier stuff with A.I. in Python.

# G.A.B.I.

General Artificial Brazilian Intelligence
